# Analysis-on-OMPI
In this project, we have performed analysis on Open Message Passing Interface (OMPI). Open MPI offers advantages for system and software vendors,
application developers and computer science researchers.

The Analysis-on-OMPI is done in the following steps:
  #.We have built the OMPI project in our local system and generated a code coverage report
  #.Next examined the locations and usages of assert and debug statements throughout the project 
  #.By using pydriller we have learnt more about the contributions.
  
There are three contributors in this project.
