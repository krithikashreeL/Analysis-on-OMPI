# Analysis-on-OMPI
In this project, we have performed analysis on Open Message Passing Interface (OMPI). Open MPI offers advantages for system and software vendors,
application developers and computer science researchers.
  
There are three contributors in this project.\
  1.KrithikaShree LakshmiNArayan\
  2.Sai Pavani Gandla\
  3.SiriChandana Balmoori
  
The Analysis-on-OMPI is done in the following steps:\
  1.We have built the OMPI project in our local system and generated a code coverage report\
  2.Next examined the locations and usages of assert and debug statements  
  3.By using pydriller we have learnt more about the contributions
  
 We placed all the coverage results that we got into the Coverage Reports folder, this folder has .png files and html files.  
 
 Python_scripts folder consists of the python files that we used for analysing assert and debug count in test and production files and it also has gen_figures.py which has script for all the plots that we generated in our project.
